      <description>What is the concept of blue and green water? Green and blue are labels that can be used both for water stored in a soil or vegetation layer and for a water flux that leaves from the soil or vegetation (like the evaporation or transpiration flow). &amp;lsquo;Green&amp;rsquo; thus means &amp;lsquo;originating from rainwater&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;blue&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;originating from groundwater or surface water&amp;rsquo;.
What is green water? Green water is the water entering soils from precipitation (and, in some locales, through irrigation) which is not lost to subsurface runoff or deep percolation and, therefore, is stored in the rooting zone, potentially available for plant uptake.</description>
