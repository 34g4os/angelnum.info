<p>Green water is the water entering soils from precipitation (and, in some locales, through irrigation) which is not lost to subsurface runoff or deep percolation and, therefore, is stored in the rooting zone, potentially available for plant uptake.</p>

<p>Results show that even though the green water is the dominant water resources, the blue water is also critical. Most of the blue water are transformed to green water through physically and human induced processes to meet the water demand of ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-known-as-blue-water">What is known as Blue Water?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-known-as-blue-water">#</a></h2>
<p>Blue water. Fresh surface and groundwater, in other words, the water in freshwater lakes, rivers and aquifers.</p>
