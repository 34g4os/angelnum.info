<p>An apology tells someone that we&rsquo;re sorry for the hurt we caused — even if we didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. It&rsquo;s a way of saying we&rsquo;re aware of what we did and we&rsquo;ll try to do better in future.</p>

<p>When they apologize, they&rsquo;re often doing so because they feel guilty about their behavior. A part of their apology is certainly expressing care for you as a person, but the first step of changing behavior is forgiving themselves for past behavior. When your ex wants to apologize, they need to forgive themselves.Sep 3, 2020</p>

<p>“Dreaming about a long-ago ex — especially a first love — is incredibly common,” says Loewenberg. “That ex becomes symbolic of passion, uninhibited desire, unafraid love, etc.” These dreams are your subconscious mind&rsquo;s way of telling you that you want more ~spice~ in your life.May 29, 2020</p>

<p>It may simply mean that you&rsquo;re still processing parts of the relationship that you&rsquo;ve yet to find true closure on. &ldquo;Dreams of getting back together with an ex-lover don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you are still carrying a torch for that person or that you will ever be back in a relationship with them,&rdquo; Walden says.Jul 20, 2019</p>

<p>It is common in politics and public relations. For example, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way&rdquo; to someone who has been offended by a statement is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and may imply the person took offense for hypersensitive or irrational reasons.</p>

<p>Jill Murray, Licensed Psychotherapist, Author, and Relationship Expert, tells Bustle. &ldquo;You should always apologize for hurtful behavior, even if you think that the person feeling that pain doesn&rsquo;t have a right to feel it, or that you wouldn&rsquo;t have been hurt by it.&ldquo;Mar 7, 2018</p>

<p>Adding “if” subtly questions whether the other person was actually hurt, creating an opening for the offender to let themself off the hook if there&rsquo;s a possibility that it didn&rsquo;t actually happen. This invalidates the other person by drawing into question their experience of their emotions and is called “gaslighting.”Jun 5, 2020</p>

<p>Over-apologizing is a common symptom amongst individuals with low self-esteem, fear of conflict and a fear of what others think. This goes hand in hand with poor boundaries, perhaps accepting blame for things we didn&rsquo;t do or couldn&rsquo;t control.May 4, 2021</p>

<p>A sincere apology allows you to let people know you&rsquo;re not proud of what you did, and won&rsquo;t be repeating the behavior.
