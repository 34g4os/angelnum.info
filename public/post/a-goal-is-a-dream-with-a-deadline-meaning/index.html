<p>There is no project until you set a deadline. The way you take control of your life is to make sure you&rsquo;ve got a deadline for every project (goal) you choose. If you want to take the guesswork out of navigating life successfully—growing and making the things you want to happen, happen—you have to set deadlines.</p>

<p>Having a dream is important, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to ever become reality without action. And, if you&rsquo;re going to take action you need to understand what needs to be done, and in which order – prioritising these actions.Apr 19, 2021</p>

<p>The reason to-do lists and deadlines are so effective is because they make large projects or goals more manageable. This type of planning can help students finish school projects, follow New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, or achieve goals, whether short term or long term. Goal setting also helps to build intrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>Dreams are something you create in your mind that can take any shape or form, while goals are based on taking action. With goals, a lot of focus and attention is needed. Dreams, on the other hand, don&rsquo;t need that kind of focus. You can sit for hours and dream without doing a single thing about it.</p>

<p>Without deadlines, the goals float out somewhere on the horizon and you flounder around trying to reach them. As soon as a goal has a deadline, it moves front and center in your sight. Think about the difference between these two statements: “I want to lose five pounds”</p>

<p>So, what does, “A goal without a plan is just a wish,” mean? In short, it means that without actionable steps, your dream is just that: a dream. It&rsquo;s nothing more than wishful thinking. And wishful thinking has never produced tangible results the way hard work and planning have.</p>
