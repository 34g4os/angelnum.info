<p>The term &ldquo;God&rsquo;s number&rdquo; is sometimes given to the graph diameter of Rubik&rsquo;s graph, which is the minimum number of turns required to solve a Rubik&rsquo;s cube from an arbitrary starting position (i.e., in the worst case). Rokicki et al. (2010) showed that this number equals 20.</p>
