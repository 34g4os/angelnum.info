<p>Dreaming is a way for the psyche to express and integrate unprocessed qualities that you believe are not acceptable. Nightmares or dreaming of something evil is actually the personification of your own misplaced power. They are a sign that something powerful and good (yet unexpressed) is coming to the surface.</p>
