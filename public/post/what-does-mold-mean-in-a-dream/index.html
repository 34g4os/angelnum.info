<p>When you dream you are eating bread, this is a sign of good things to come. Expect an increase in abundance. You might incur more wealth and power in the near future than you have dreamed of. In older dream dictionaries, special attention has been paid to situations when a woman dreams of eating a piece of bread.Jul 4, 2021</p>
