<p>Studies show that your dream consciousness is very similar to your waking consciousness, so dreaming about someone you don&rsquo;t talk to anymore points to daily emotions you&rsquo;re currently feeling (and may need to process).Oct 19, 2019</p>

<p>Many people glamourize jealousy by saying it&rsquo;s a sign of love. It&rsquo;s not! It&rsquo;s a sign of insecurity and reflective of seeing your partner as an object to be possessed. It&rsquo;s a negative emotion stemming from both desire and insecurity, but not love.Sep 28, 2015</p>
