<p>Sometimes the dreams we have seem so real. Most of the emotions, sensations, and images we feel and visualize are those that we can say we have seen or experienced in real life. This is because the same parts of the brain that are active when we are awake are also active when we are in certain stages of our sleep.Oct 20, 2021</p>

<p>What Are Lucid Dreams? Lucid dreams are when you know that you&rsquo;re dreaming while you&rsquo;re asleep.
