So, have no fear if you’re happily coupled up and still dreaming about sleeping with strangers or your boss. According to Loewenberg, sex in a dream most often represents a desire to connect to some internal aspect of that person, like a trait or behavior, rather than their physical body.Aug 24, 2021\nHow can I control my wet dreams? There’s nothing you can do to control or stop wet dreams, but once you start releasing sperm by masturbating or having sex with a partner, you may have fewer of them. There are many different problems that can occur with ejaculation, ranging from delayed or premature ejaculation, to painful or retrograde ejaculation.Apr 26, 2021\nWhat causes intimate dreams? Although sex dreams aren’t necessarily about sex, Dr. Johnson points out that a lack of sex in one’s waking life could lead to sexual dreams. The reason for this is to “satisfy physical impulses.” In other words, your brain knows when your body needs a sexual release.Sep 26, 2018\nCan you have intimate dreams? They are also quite common. More than 70% of people report experiencing a sex dream6 at least once in their life. Even if the content of the dream is unnerving — for example, a dream of sleeping with your boss or cheating on your partner — it doesn’t necessarily mean that something is wrong.Mar 11, 2022\n",
